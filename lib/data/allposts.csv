"Science Discussion: Last week a team of scientists in China announced that they used the genome editing technology CRISPR-Cas9 to alter the DNA of human embryos, resulting in the birth of twin girls. Let’s discuss the technology and ethics of this development! Hi [reddit](https://i.imgur.com/sqOjWz6.png)! Last week, [researchers announced at the Second International Summit on Human Genome Editing that they had altered the genomes of twin girls](https://www.statnews.com/2018/11/26/claim-of-crispred-baby-girls-stuns-genome-editing-summit/) using [CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YKFw2KZA5o) approaches. This marks the first time that we know of that this technology has been used to modify humans.

He Jiankui had previously presented work on genome editing in human, monkey, and mouse embryos at a scientific meeting in 2017, but he had made no indication at the time that he intended to use the altered embryos to initiate a pregnancy.

Based on the announcement last week, He Jiankui’s institution, Southern University of Science and Technology in Shenzhen, issued a statement indicating that it had been unaware of the research and that this work had “seriously violated academic ethics and codes of conduct.” Rice University [has also launched an ethics investigation](https://www.statnews.com/2018/11/26/rice-university-opens-investigation-into-researcher-who-worked-on-crisprd-baby-project/) into He Jiankui's doctoral advisor and collaborator, Michael Deem, who is a professor in bioengineering.

The research has yet to be published in a peer-reviewed paper, so many details of the results remain unknown at this time. It is important to note that gene editing with CRISPR is also being actively pursued in the United States to help correct severe genetic diseases - the company Editas Medicine [recently received FDA approval](https://www.statnews.com/2018/11/30/editas-crispr-trial/) for a clinical trial for a CRISPR-based treatment for LCA10, a rare form of blindness.

To answer your questions about this news we have guests from George Church’s lab at Harvard who are experts in gene editing technology, and a prominent ethicist from Vanderbilt University.

**Ellen Clayton, MD, JD** (u/Ellen_Clayton): I am a general pediatrician and law professor who focuses on ethical, legal, and social issues raised by genetics.  I was a member of the NASEM committee on gene editing.

**Eriona Hysolli, PhD** (u/Eriona_Hysolli): I am a postdoc in the Church lab exploring multiplex gene editing for mammoth de-extinction.

**Cory Smith, PhD** (u/Cory_Smith_PhD): I am a postdoctoral research fellow working in the Church lab on synthetic biology technology development for Genome Project write. One of my research aims is to improve the delivery, efficiency, and safety of current DNA editors including CRISPR/Cas9, TALENs, AAV, and Base Editors to overcome the current limitations preventing multiplex engineering at genome-wide scale in mammalian cells.",1

FREE DAPS has primarily been a live show freestyle/improv rap crew and are now trying our hand at music videos, filmed freestyles, &amp; sketch.

Our group is like Lil Dicky meets Wutang meets Whose Line meets the internet. More focused on the rap skill than The Lonely Island or Flight Of The Concords but more focused on the comedy than an Eminem or Childish Gambino.

We released 10 music videos since Nov 1, including 4 for Christmas. Our latest, ""White Tanktop Christmas"", is a melodramatic anthem for all warm weather states during the holidays. Linked here:

Given the current hypersensitive / hostile climate for comedy, (and even Christmas songs) these days, I am trying to decide whether or not to include this 4 minute chunk on my next CD, tentatively titled, ""Unchecked"".     


My favourite comedy is that which straddles the fine line between funny and offensive, and this piece most certainly does.  Its also my professional and personal response to the question, ""What should we laugh at?"".   And a way of threading the needle on a couple of topics that many would say are ""off limits"".    Thoughts?

"Netflix Cut Out Awkward spot with Hasan Minhaj on ""Bumping Mics""Watching episode 2 of Bumping Mics last night (December 8) on Netflix and I noticed something strange. Jeff Ross calls Hasan Minhaj to the stage and this whole section seems kind of forced and awkward. Dave Attell doesn't really greet Hasan when he gets on stage. In general, it seems like Hasan is only on as a plug for his show on Netflix and Attell doesn't seem all that thrilled. At the end of the bit, Hasan hugs Ross and then when he makes his way towards Attell, Dave just gestures for him to exit the stage. 
This stood out as being just a pretty cringy interaction. 
Today (December 9) I tried to show the clip to my GF and it seems as though Netflix has completely cut and re-edited the ending of the Hasan Minhaj segment. I thought I remember there being a few more jokes after the Aladdin comments and then the awkward goodbye. 
Upon revisiting, the bit is cut right after Ross's Aladdin remarks and then exit is from a different angle and shows no hug. 

Does anyone else remember this or notice this change?

He simply asked for consent and then did his deed which, granted he was a star figure and he may have been employing some of these women, but they could have easily said no and walked out of the room. There is no indication of Louis threatening these women or perusing those who brushed off his advances in anyway shape or form.

"Who are the audiences for Aziz and CK now?Before, Ansari’s audience would likely be college-educated liberal millennial and Generation Xers.  Now,
he’s probably lost some.  How many, I don’t know.  I do remember reading some scoffing remarks of his recent Milwaukee sets.  Aziz was seen as an Uber-Woke feminist, and that’s obviously down the tube.  However, it seems like most of his peers supported him.

CK’s audience was more interesting.  It was college-educated liberals from millennial up... but also a kind of select group of guys.  Guys that didn’t care about being PC or woke, guys that still listened to Cumia and Opie and Carolla and frankly probably didn’t agree with CK’s personal politics.  But they still loved Louis and his frank descriptions of being a self-deprecating scumbag guy.  And it seems like all but a few close personal friends like Silverman, Maron, and maybe a few others like Norton have washed their hands of him.  I doubt we’ll see a lot of movies or TV shows, just more standup.  If that.

I think it’s interesting to see what happens.  I think the audience for both is still there, but so is the backlash.  I don’t think either are ever sniffing social media again.",0

My roommate and I have an inside joke based on a David O'Doherty bit I saw on Youtube several years back. Recently I've been trying to find it in order to show him the full bit, but it's been no use and so I'm in need of some assistance.

&amp;#x200B;

From what I remember, the bit involves:

* O'Doherty having a phone argument with his then-girlfriend while driving along a bridge.
* He has enough and throws his phone out the window, with her still on the line.
* He would like to think that she stayed on and reacted to the ""bloop"" \[he literally says bloop\] of it hitting the water with ""what the f--- do you mean, bloop!?""
* Then he said that ""I'd also like to think a fish swam by while she screamed and just kinda went 'AHHH F--- OFF!""

"What separates good comedy from bad?I’m currently working on a retail-based sitcom and just watched something similar for inspiration. It was a series on Netflix called Rostered On, and while I wanted to like it, and while I found the points they were making very relatable and satirical, almost like Office Space, it was just very unfunny.

I was trying to imagine better/funnier actors saying these lines and I thought it might be a bit funnier, but I still couldn’t put my finger on why it wasn’t making me laugh.

Does anyone have any theories on what separates good comedy from bad? As I personally feel it’s quite a fine line, with multiple factors (the script, but also the performers, editing, direction etc). 

Is it possible to have a funny script but for it to not turn out funny because of other elements? Which do you think is the more important in terms of making people laugh? The script or the performer?

EDIT: grammar.",0

"Comedy Career Advice: Is stand-up the right medium for me?Hey all, 

So recently I've had a lot of friends tell me I should try stand-up. I love stand-up and its critiques &amp; influences on society, but for the life of me I cannot write a joke. 

I occasionally have a great story full of humorous dialogue, but for the most part I feel like people find me funny because of my quick-witted responses, my references, my shock factor and my absurdity. 

I'm not really sure how to translate this comedy into standup. Or perhaps there are other comedy careers that work better with this skill. 

What do you guys think? Whoever got this far, thanks for even taking the time to read..",0

"Bill Murrays/Jim Halperts Humor TypeI haven't seen this posted anywhere, so I decided to post it here. 

I am very eager to learn the humor style of Bill Murray. I've read some books, seen some videos, but haven't been able to find a guide on how to make your own witty lines or how Bill Murray seems to be so good at playing characters like Peter Venkman, Tripper Harrison, and Phil. 

I know that the general style of humor is 'dry humor.' But when I look that up, the humor is funny but just not Bill Murray. It's certainly in the same realm, but doesn't have the same goofy and care-free charm of Murray. 

I guess what I'm asking for is any recommendations to books or any tutorial on how to gain the same charm as him. 

Here are some examples: 

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCHGzxSBn-c](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCHGzxSBn-c)

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL8AVWVxHgY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vL8AVWVxHgY)

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJrEkwdSFew](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJrEkwdSFew)

Jim from The Office has a very similar humor type but a little less goofy and more realistic. Small witty remarks, goofy faces, and goofy antics. I really want to master this type of comedy but I don't know how!

"I know I'm like 12 years too late... but...[Meta] Can we establish that the Dane Cook vs Louis CK joke stealing fiasco is stupid?

Yeah I've seen the naming kids/ Itchy Asshole argument.

But what I don't understand is that why does Louis get a free pass from everyone for blatantly stealing jokes?

[Here is Seinfeld on Supermarkets](https://youtu.be/J020Hmu7P-g?t=1356)

[Here is Louis CK on Walmart](https://youtu.be/WrN9Ncl8kFk?t=391)


What I don't understand is that this joke is from the exact special of Louis's that people claim Dane was stealing from. So it's not like people just haven't seen this... Am I the only one who noticed this?

EDIT: Specifically the comparison ""It's like a casino there's no clocks, no windows"" This is a very specific comment to make... and far more suspicious than the Dane Cook argument

DISCLAIMER: I like Louis CK's comedy. I think he's very talented. I don't particularly like Dane Cook. But that doesn't mean I should accuse one of plagiarism and give the other a pass. ",0

"The black bean.When I was ten years old I remember one day I was helping my mom cook. A typical korean meal has a bowl of rice with stew, and the side dishes(kimchi) forsure.

Anyways my mom decided on a certain marinated black bean side dish. She asked me to wash the beans so she could cook them, while she prepares the sauce. I washed the beans and moved them to the pot. As my mom got with the sauce she started to cook up the beans, then she turnes around to grab the sauce to start the marination. 
As a ten year old, my curiosity took over. How big is a bean? Could one fit up in my nose? A unresistable impulse took over. I reached in and grabbed a fat one. I looked over to make sure mom couldnt see. I quickly sized the bean and shoved it up my nose. The bean felt like a booger but I was satisfied with myself. As i rolled my eyes towards my mom i felt her was turning around towards me. Without my conscious awareness I exhaled thru my nose. The air rushing, pushing the bean out. I saw it flying thru the air towards the pot. I tried to catch it midair, realizing too late what this meant.
Later that night during dinner my whole family complimented my mom on the black bean dish but I only ate my stew and rice. :))))))",0

"Michael Che n Colin Jost( and the SNL players ) show us how comedy sometimes doesn't work- at the 2018 Emmys...From poor timing to badly fleshed out skits(sketches), last night's Emmys were as funny as pancreatic cancer. When they tried to be topical, they had bad timing or the words weren't punchy enough; when they tried to be ironic, they had all the skills of a badly burned wooden puppet. How do you even begin to make the duo of Maya Rudolph n Fred Armisen completely unfunny? we got a textbook answer last night in how that's done. The only things that could've made it less funny and more cringe-y would have been to have Ellen DeGeneres dance from desperation or Tim Allen make some testosterone sounds and tell a manjoke. Honestly, I think I could've stomached Carrot Top n Gallagher hosting the show and at least chuckled from  a 'sheesh that was so stupid' moment. Is comedy now officially dead on network tv??!!!",0

**Spokesman**: Lot, who are your visitor friends?  
**Lot**: Some weary travelers. They'll be gone in the morning.  
**Spokesman**: Bring them out here.  
**Lot**: I don't want to disturb them, plus I think they may be angels.  
**Spokesman**: Angels, eh. How do you know?  
**Lot**: As they approached the house there was a divine rumbling in the earth, and a holy blue glow around...   
**Spokesman**: Did you try to fuck them?  
**Lot**: What? No!  
**Spokesman**: How do you know they're angels if you haven't tried to fuck them?  
**Lot:** What does that have to do with anything?  
**Spokesman**: Look Lot, bring them on out and we’ll fuck them for you, settle this whole angel thing once and for all.   
**Angel**: Who's that?  
**Lot**: They want to have sex with you.  
**Angel**: Oh.  
**Lot**: Go back to bed. And you go away!  
**Spokesman**: Well, here's the thing. Not until we have sex with them. If you won't bring them out we'll just have to burn your house down to get them then, right? \[Crowd agrees\]  
**Angel**: If it’s the only way to save your house... I'm coming out now!  
**Lot**: No. No you don't. What about my virgin daughters? How about that? You can fuck them.  
**Spokesman**: You'd rather we fuck your daughters than some strangers you just found wandering along the road?  
**Lot**: I'll just go wake them then -  
**Spokesman**: That won't work, Lot. We already fucked your daughters. We're coming in.  
**Lot**: ... disgusting pigs!  
**Spokesman**: Oh oh, that's nice. That's nice. Look at Mr. Judge and Jury over here who'll let us fuck his own daughters but won't throw us some randos from the road.  
**Lot**: Go fuck yourselves, then.  
**Spokesman**: Yeah, we would do that, but see, we work together Monday through Thursday. We wouldn't want to make things awkward.  
**Lot**: I'm closing the door now.  
**Spokesman**: Wait. What if we fucked them just a little bit?  
**Angel**: Well if it's just a little...  
**Lot**: You be quiet.  
**Spokesman**: Yeah just a little bit. Maybe a reach-around or a handy. Third base, tops.

"Idea for a sketch, snl, perhaps?I love vintage radio drama. One of my favorite shows was hosted by a young Orson Welles, ""the Black museum"". It is an actual place, in Scotland yard, where they store murder weapons of all types. Some obvious, some innocuous. Orson would describe the object, in his inimitable way, introduce the main characters and start the story of how this item came to be a murder weapon.
I had  just finished breakfast this morning and was driving home with my wife and daughter when this idea came to me out of nowhere.

"Stand-Up Comedy QuestionSo, I am a senior in high school and love comedy. I really love smart comedy that makes you think as well. When it comes to stand up I love people who tell really good stories and people who get into their political opinions. Stand up is something I've always wanted to do but felt I wasn't very funny and have stage freight. 

So, last year I decided to sign up for theater just because I like acting. Well, turns out in theater we do a lot of improv and I found out that being on stage doesn't bother me and that I can come up with really funny things on the spot.

I still would like to try out stand up comedy but I don't know how to write jokes. When I sit down to try and make something funny, I think it turns out completely stupid. Even if I tell someone something that happened that was funny, people tend to not laugh. 

I really enjoy making people laugh and love improv because I make a joke out of every scenario pretty much and get a good reaction from the audience. But stand up is something I want to try at least once in my life.

My favourite comedy is that which straddles the fine line between funny and offensive, and this piece most certainly does.

"Netflix Cut Out Awkward spot with Hasan Minhaj on ""Bumping Mics"" Watching episode 2 of Bumping Mics last night (December 8) on Netflix and I noticed something strange. Jeff Ross calls Hasan Minhaj to the stage and this whole section seems kind of forced and awkward. Dave Attell doesn't really greet Hasan when he gets on stage. In general, it seems like Hasan is only on as a plug for his show on Netflix and Attell doesn't seem all that thrilled. At the end of the bit, Hasan hugs Ross and then when he makes his way towards Attell, Dave just gestures for him to exit the stage. 
This stood out as being just a pretty cringy interaction. 
Today (December 9) I tried to show the clip to my GF and it seems as though Netflix has completely cut and re-edited the ending of the Hasan Minhaj segment. I thought I remember there being a few more jokes after the Aladdin comments and then the awkward goodbye. 
Upon revisiting, the bit is cut right after Ross's Aladdin remarks and then exit is from a different angle and shows no hug. 

Does anyone else remember this or notice this change?

"Help me write a funny Christmas poem for my clients? Hello

I have an accounting business and I put a lot of effort into cheeky Christmas cards to my clients.  I was super underprepared this year and sh** the bed on putting something decent together for them in time.  I usually send out a professional card for the clients I'm not friends with and funny one to the ones I have less professional boundaries with/hangout with outside of work.  Any poets out there able to help me  or motivate me with some clever rhymes?  Nerdy accounting jargon, slang, swearing permitted.  Nothing sexual.  I'm a single female who works with a lot of married men and want to keep my clients.  

Thank ya

"Pun ideas incorporating the name “Ashley”? TL;DR: I need a catchy nickname for my Comedy Sportz (Improv) team. 


In Comedy Sportz, competitive improv, you are introduced by the announcer under a pun-related nickname. 


The name would go along this format:

“Next up, we have **FirstName** ‘*PUN*’ **LastName**!”


Some examples of this are 

-Nick “Knack Paddywhack” Brown

-Samantha “This Is The” Joyce

-Ari “S P E C T” Smith


My name is Ashley, and my last name begins with the word Egg. Do y’all have any pun ideas?

Hear me out just a bit. if  you read what he actually did with these women he mostly just asked them if he could jerk off in front of them; some said yes a few didn't say anything. He simply asked for consent and then did his deed which, granted he was a star figure and he may have been employing some of these women, but they could have easily said no and walked out of the room. There is no indication of Louis threatening these women or perusing those who brushed off his advances in anyway shape or form. Louis got caught up in a big Metoo bullshit wave and is being swept out of comedy despite being a great comedian and creator.  ",0

"Who are the audiences for Aziz and CK now? Before, Ansari’s audience would likely be college-educated liberal millennial and Generation Xers.  Now,
he’s probably lost some.  How many, I don’t know.  I do remember reading some scoffing remarks of his recent Milwaukee sets.  Aziz was seen as an Uber-Woke feminist, and that’s obviously down the tube.  However, it seems like most of his peers supported him.

CK’s audience was more interesting.  It was college-educated liberals from millennial up... but also a kind of select group of guys.  Guys that didn’t care about being PC or woke, guys that still listened to Cumia and Opie and Carolla and frankly probably didn’t agree with CK’s personal politics.  But they still loved Louis and his frank descriptions of being a self-deprecating scumbag guy.  And it seems like all but a few close personal friends like Silverman, Maron, and maybe a few others like Norton have washed their hands of him.  I doubt we’ll see a lot of movies or TV shows, just more standup.  If that.

I think it’s interesting to see what happens.  I think the audience for both is still there, but so is the backlash.  I don’t think either are ever sniffing social media again.",0

"Looking for a specific David O'Doherty bit on phone arguments. Good day, everyone.

&amp;#x200B;

My roommate and I have an inside joke based on a David O'Doherty bit I saw on Youtube several years back. Recently I've been trying to find it in order to show him the full bit, but it's been no use and so I'm in need of some assistance.

&amp;#x200B;

From what I remember, the bit involves:

* O'Doherty having a phone argument with his then-girlfriend while driving along a bridge.
* He has enough and throws his phone out the window, with her still on the line.
* He would like to think that she stayed on and reacted to the ""bloop"" \[he literally says bloop\] of it hitting the water with ""what the f--- do you mean, bloop!?""
* Then he said that ""I'd also like to think a fish swam by while she screamed and just kinda went 'AHHH F--- OFF!""

&amp;#x200B;

If you can find the bit, or even the special that it was in, I'd be very appreciative!",0

"What separates good comedy from bad? I’m currently working on a retail-based sitcom and just watched something similar for inspiration. It was a series on Netflix called Rostered On, and while I wanted to like it, and while I found the points they were making very relatable and satirical, almost like Office Space, it was just very unfunny.

I was trying to imagine better/funnier actors saying these lines and I thought it might be a bit funnier, but I still couldn’t put my finger on why it wasn’t making me laugh.

Does anyone have any theories on what separates good comedy from bad? As I personally feel it’s quite a fine line, with multiple factors (the script, but also the performers, editing, direction etc). 

Is it possible to have a funny script but for it to not turn out funny because of other elements? Which do you think is the more important in terms of making people laugh? The script or the performer?

"Comedy Career Advice: Is stand-up the right medium for me? Hey all, 

So recently I've had a lot of friends tell me I should try stand-up. I love stand-up and its critiques &amp; influences on society, but for the life of me I cannot write a joke. 

I occasionally have a great story full of humorous dialogue, but for the most part I feel like people find me funny because of my quick-witted responses, my references, my shock factor and my absurdity. 

I'm not really sure how to translate this comedy into standup. Or perhaps there are other comedy careers that work better with this skill.

"Bill Murrays/Jim Halperts Humor Type I haven't seen this posted anywhere, so I decided to post it here. 

I am very eager to learn the humor style of Bill Murray. I've read some books, seen some videos, but haven't been able to find a guide on how to make your own witty lines or how Bill Murray seems to be so good at playing characters like Peter Venkman, Tripper Harrison, and Phil. 

I know that the general style of humor is 'dry humor.' But when I look that up, the humor is funny but just not Bill Murray. It's certainly in the same realm, but doesn't have the same goofy and care-free charm of Murray. 

I guess what I'm asking for is any recommendations to books or any tutorial on how to gain the same charm as him. 

Here are some examples:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJrEkwdSFew](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJrEkwdSFew)

Jim from The Office has a very similar humor type but a little less goofy and more realistic. Small witty remarks, goofy faces, and goofy antics. I really want to master this type of comedy but I don't know how!

Kavanaugh is an alien who abducted me 40 years ago. I think I was out in the woods by a sort of river, stream, pond, maybe. He probed me with his alien thingy. He was flying a real cool smokey spaceship, not like a motorhome in Spaceballs.

"I know I'm like 12 years too late... but... [Meta] Can we establish that the Dane Cook vs Louis CK joke stealing fiasco is stupid?

Yeah I've seen the naming kids/ Itchy Asshole argument.

But what I don't understand is that why does Louis get a free pass from everyone for blatantly stealing jokes?

[Here is Seinfeld on Supermarkets](https://youtu.be/J020Hmu7P-g?t=1356)

[Here is Louis CK on Walmart](https://youtu.be/WrN9Ncl8kFk?t=391)


What I don't understand is that this joke is from the exact special of Louis's that people claim Dane was stealing from. So it's not like people just haven't seen this... Am I the only one who noticed this?

EDIT: Specifically the comparison ""It's like a casino there's no clocks, no windows"" This is a very specific comment to make... and far more suspicious than the Dane Cook argument

DISCLAIMER: I like Louis CK's comedy. I think he's very talented. I don't particularly like Dane Cook. But that doesn't mean I should accuse one of plagiarism and give the other a pass. ",0

"The black bean. When I was ten years old I remember one day I was helping my mom cook. A typical korean meal has a bowl of rice with stew, and the side dishes(kimchi) forsure.

Anyways my mom decided on a certain marinated black bean side dish. She asked me to wash the beans so she could cook them, while she prepares the sauce. I washed the beans and moved them to the pot. As my mom got with the sauce she started to cook up the beans, then she turnes around to grab the sauce to start the marination. 
As a ten year old, my curiosity took over. How big is a bean? Could one fit up in my nose? A unresistable impulse took over. I reached in and grabbed a fat one. I looked over to make sure mom couldnt see. I quickly sized the bean and shoved it up my nose. The bean felt like a booger but I was satisfied with myself. As i rolled my eyes towards my mom i felt her was turning around towards me. Without my conscious awareness I exhaled thru my nose. The air rushing, pushing the bean out. I saw it flying thru the air towards the pot. I tried to catch it midair, realizing too late what this meant.
Later that night during dinner my whole family complimented my mom on the black bean dish but I only ate my stew and rice. :))))))",0

"Michael Che n Colin Jost( and the SNL players ) show us how comedy sometimes doesn't work- at the 2018 Emmys... From poor timing to badly fleshed out skits(sketches), last night's Emmys were as funny as pancreatic cancer. When they tried to be topical, they had bad timing or the words weren't punchy enough; when they tried to be ironic, they had all the skills of a badly burned wooden puppet. How do you even begin to make the duo of Maya Rudolph n Fred Armisen completely unfunny? we got a textbook answer last night in how that's done. The only things that could've made it less funny and more cringe-y would have been to have Ellen DeGeneres dance from desperation or Tim Allen make some testosterone sounds and tell a manjoke. Honestly, I think I could've stomached Carrot Top n Gallagher hosting the show and at least chuckled from  a 'sheesh that was so stupid' moment. Is comedy now officially dead on network tv??!!!",0

"The story of Lot at Sodom \[Crowd with torches gathers around house, throwing sticks at it\]

**Lot**: What? What do you want?  
**Spokesman**: Lot, who are your visitor friends?  
**Lot**: Some weary travelers. They'll be gone in the morning.  
**Spokesman**: Bring them out here.  
**Lot**: I don't want to disturb them, plus I think they may be angels.  
**Spokesman**: Angels, eh. How do you know?  
**Lot**: As they approached the house there was a divine rumbling in the earth, and a holy blue glow around...   
**Spokesman**: Did you try to fuck them?  
**Lot**: What? No!  
**Spokesman**: How do you know they're angels if you haven't tried to fuck them?  
**Lot:** What does that have to do with anything?  
**Spokesman**: Look Lot, bring them on out and we’ll fuck them for you, settle this whole angel thing once and for all.   
**Angel**: Who's that?  
**Lot**: They want to have sex with you.  
**Angel**: Oh.  
**Lot**: Go back to bed. And you go away!  
**Spokesman**: Well, here's the thing. Not until we have sex with them. If you won't bring them out we'll just have to burn your house down to get them then, right? \[Crowd agrees\]  
**Angel**: If it’s the only way to save your house... I'm coming out now!  
**Lot**: No. No you don't. What about my virgin daughters? How about that? You can fuck them.  
**Spokesman**: You'd rather we fuck your daughters than some strangers you just found wandering along the road?  
**Lot**: I'll just go wake them then -  
**Spokesman**: That won't work, Lot. We already fucked your daughters. We're coming in.  
**Lot**: ... disgusting pigs!  
**Spokesman**: Oh oh, that's nice. That's nice. Look at Mr. Judge and Jury over here who'll let us fuck his own daughters but won't throw us some randos from the road.  
**Lot**: Go fuck yourselves, then.  
**Spokesman**: Yeah, we would do that, but see, we work together Monday through Thursday. We wouldn't want to make things awkward.  
**Lot**: I'm closing the door now.  
**Spokesman**: Wait. What if we fucked them just a little bit?  
**Angel**: Well if it's just a little...  
**Lot**: You be quiet.  
**Spokesman**: Yeah just a little bit. Maybe a reach-around or a handy. Third base, tops.

\[Door closes\]  \[Crowd is disappointed\]  
**Spokesman**: Shit.  
**Group member**: My cousin Egret's in town. Suppose we can fuck her then?  
**Spokesman**: Yeah, come on then.",0
"Idea for a sketch, snl, perhaps? I love vintage radio drama. One of my favorite shows was hosted by a young Orson Welles, ""the Black museum"". It is an actual place, in Scotland yard, where they store murder weapons of all types. Some obvious, some innocuous. Orson would describe the object, in his inimitable way, introduce the main characters and start the story of how this item came to be a murder weapon.
I had  just finished breakfast this morning and was driving home with my wife and daughter when this idea came to me out of nowhere.
""The Brown museum""
Too bad Bill Hader has moved on, he would be perfect for this.

"Stand-Up Comedy Question So, I am a senior in high school and love comedy. I really love smart comedy that makes you think as well. When it comes to stand up I love people who tell really good stories and people who get into their political opinions. Stand up is something I've always wanted to do but felt I wasn't very funny and have stage freight. 

So, last year I decided to sign up for theater just because I like acting. Well, turns out in theater we do a lot of improv and I found out that being on stage doesn't bother me and that I can come up with really funny things on the spot.

I still would like to try out stand up comedy but I don't know how to write jokes. When I sit down to try and make something funny, I think it turns out completely stupid. Even if I tell someone something that happened that was funny, people tend to not laugh. 

I really enjoy making people laugh and love improv because I make a joke out of every scenario pretty much and get a good reaction from the audience. But stand up is something I want to try at least once in my life.

Comedians on here who have done stand up, what are some tips you have for making your jokes and making them land? ",0

"What happened to Nimesh Patel, from someone who was actually there.&gt;Mainstream media has focused on a joke that Patel told during his set, but it has utterly failed to report other important details. For example: about 30 minutes into Nimesh Patel’s set, he started badgering a woman in the audience about what her parents did for a living. She responded multiple times that she had nothing to share about her father because she hasn’t been in contact with him for a while. To the audience it was apparent that she was uncomfortable with the attention and the invasion of her privacy. Yet, Patel continued to push, even despite the growing silence that took over the audience.

&gt;Patel persisted in asking multiple inappropriate questions of this audience member, like “Why don’t you know [your father]? Why aren’t you talking to him?” An attempt at comedy quickly soured into unprovoked personal harassment of a student. cultureSHOCK’s ethic is to empower people in their identities and experiences, but Patel’s demeaning performance was instead subjecting an audience member with unwanted public scrutiny, and putting the rest of the audience on edge.

&gt;It was at that moment when the three show directors from Columbia University’s Asian American Alliance (AAA) went on stage and let Patel know that his set was ending early.

http://reappropriate.co/2018/12/im-an-asian-american-student-at-columbia-university-and-nimesh-patels-mic-needed-to-be-cut/?fbclid=IwAR3XofE0MQUZIboEEA0otABeoSuZV_0p-HR7CiUsbB5I0sCaaJxDV4f7nW8
